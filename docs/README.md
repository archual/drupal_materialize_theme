## Terminology

The term **"bootstrap"** can be used excessively through out this project's
documentation. For clarity, we will attempt to use it verbosely in one of the
following ways:

- **[Drupal Bootstrap]** refers to the Drupal base theme project.
- **[Bootstrap Framework](http://getbootstrap.com)** refers to the external
  front end framework.
- **[drupal_bootstrap](https://api.drupal.org/apis/drupal_bootstrap)** refers
  to Drupal's bootstrapping process or phase.
  
When referring to files inside the [Drupal Bootstrap] project directory, they
will always start with `./` and continue to specify the full path to the file
or directory inside it. For example, the file that is responsible for displaying
this text is located at `./README.md`.

When referring to files inside a sub-theme, they will always start with
`./example_subtheme/` and continue to specify the full path to the file or
directory inside it. For example, the main file Drupal will search for:
`./example_subtheme/template.php`.
